				<h2>	The data subset	</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><h3>	What is the subject matter of the dataset?		</h3>
						<i>
							The data is based on the discoveries of planets that are found, that do not orbit around our star. 
							These planets are collectively known as exoplanets. 
							They are collected and collated into a large CSV file with 25 headings, listed and defined under general categories. 
							The data describes the general information of the findings, data about the planets, and data about the solar system they belong to, if applicable.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	What is the origin of the dataset -- how do you think it was generated or compiled?		</h3>
						<i>
							The data compilation was started in 2011 January, as per their first commit on Github. 
							Information was compiled by hand into the CSV file from scientific sources then pushed to Github.
							Additions are made by commits to the repository sourced from discovery sources, particularly NASA.
							The efforts towards the database are decentralised, and community driven.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	Is any cleanup needed before it is usable in a visualisation? How would you perform the cleanup?			</h3>
						<i>
							There are some columns where the data pool is too small to get any useful data from. 
							The column ‘Age’ has only two data points in over 4,000 entries, and so will be excluded with a disclaimer. 
							Some fields have biased data, where there is a significant data pool to make a representation of the data, but not enough to avoid being potentially misleading. 
							Finally, the time and dates need to be read in a particular order, as the field is not in the usual format.
							<br/><br/>
							Fields with too little data will be outright excluded, unless a reason to include them arises. 
							Partial data will have null entries excluded, and a disclaimer produced to indicate the lack of full data set. 
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	Does the data need to be pre-processed (e.g. summarised, ...) before it can be used in the visualisation that you have in mind? How would you perform that pre-processing?			</h3>
						<i>
							Similar to question 3, some data will need to have the null data culled to represent suitable data pools for the user, and to decrease the load on the server. 
							This will be pre-culled and sorted into a smaller data set for the user to manipulate.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	How do you expect (at this early stage) that your visualisation application will load the dataset? E.g. database, from file, hard-coded in your javascript program, ... Why?			</h3>
						<i>
							The visualisation will load the data set from a database which will be at least in 3rd normalisation. 
							This will help compile the data into useable and relevant chunks through which the user can make informed and meaningful analysis of the data. 
							This also helps with itemising the data for visualisation, and trying to understand common links between them that may present interest.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	Can the dataset change, or is it possible that additional data is captured that can be used seamlessly in your visualisation?			</h3>
						<i>
							The dataset will be allowed to be changed and updated. There will be some processing of data that will prevent the integration from working seamlessly. 
							It is expected that any addition or changes to data will be reflected to the workable data the user uses within a reasonable period, however, not immediately.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	With reference to the Week 2 lecture slides on diverse taxonomies for data, characterise the dataset in the context of these considerations.			</h3>
						<i>
							The data is a highly structured one, focusing on nominal comparisons after selecting specific attributes through which to limit data. 
							The data will focus on higher level choices which filter out the majority of data, and will produce smaller unnormalized files for which to create graphical representations for.
						</i>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>	Visualisation of the data		</h2>
				<ol>
					<li><h3>	What story will the visualisation tell?			</h3>
						<i>
							The visualisation will focus on the comparisons of different planets, explaining the general scope of common characteristics of planets, and uncommon characteristics through experimentation. 
							The graphical data of the planets is expected to be incomplete, but representative of what kinds of planets exist.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	Who is the target audience?			</h3>
						<i>
							The target audience is expected to be in the age range of 20-35, with an interest in science and astronomy. 
							There is anticipation that those looking at the visualisations and graphics are seeking to look at and experiment to find more answers than immediately seen on the surface.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	What questions will the visualisation help your audience to answer?			</h3>
						<i>
							The visualisation is expected to help answer specific, common traits for planets under varying measurements. 
							There is anticipation that a user will want to know how many results there are and what results cause drastic changes in statistics. 
							Users will also know how similar our solar system is in regards to other systems.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	What questions will it help the audience to raise? 			</h3>
						<i>
							The visualisation is expected to make the audience question if there are similarities between certain facets not covered. 
							For example, this visualisation will focus on high-level selection, then granular correlation where there is meaningful information. 
							They may wish to know how frequently something was dispute or contended before finalised. 
							Some of this information is beyond the scope of the data given, but will encourage users to source their own answers.
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	With reference to the Week 1 lecture slides (slides #23 - #30) on ethical issues, are there any dangers of your solution possibly misleading the audience, dependent on the method of visualisation? If so, what will you do to avoid ethical problems?			</h3>
						<i>
							There are several ethical issues raised. 
							Several fields have significant amounts of null values, which will have to be culled and then a representation given off data with useable values. 
							Because the null values do not line up across fields, there will be several visualisations which have biased information.
							<br/><br/>
							Disclaimers will be used where appropriate to demonstrate specific exception cases. 
							A graph will show how much of the data is used to show the visual representation for more general cases
						</i>
					</li>
					<li><h3>	Which of the following two styles do you currently plan for your solution:		</h3>	
								<ul>
									<li>A visualisation that contains only one view/representation, but this representation is relatively novel and creative (not your standard bar charts etc);</li>
									<li>One that employs multiple coordinated (or linked) views where each one is a standard method (e.g. a bar chart) but they work together to tell the story.</li>
								</ul>
						<i>
							The visualisation is expected to be multiple or coordinated views, linked together to let users explore and experiment with the data. 
							This is due to the large amount of data and missing data that would otherwise skew a more detailed and singular approach.
						</i>
