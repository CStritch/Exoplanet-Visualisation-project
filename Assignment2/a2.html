					<a href='../images/DataCountChart.png'><img alt="DataCountChart" height="250" widtch="250" src='../images/DataCountChart.png'/></a>
					<h4>Data Count Chart. (Click to view larger image)</h4>
					<p>
						This data chart displays the counted data entries of basic planet properties in order of: ‘Planet Mass’, ‘Radius’, ‘Period’, ‘Semi-major Axis’, ‘Eccentricity’, ‘Periastron’, ‘Longitude’, ‘Ascending Node’, ‘Inclination’ and ‘Surface Temperature’. The graph displays what data is most quantified and useable for the purposes of an interactive website. <br/><br/>
						The data provided for ‘Longitude’ and ‘Ascending node’ is too limited and will not be used for any comparison data. The data will only be used for individual planet data. The main data lies in the ‘Period’ data field, and will be used strongly to create most comparisons. Any other data set comparisons will be used with caution. ‘Eccentricity’, ‘Periastron’ and ‘Inclination’ have smaller data pools, but enough to be considered for use.

					<h4>Discovery Type Analysis. (Click to view larger image)</h4>
					<p>
					This chart shows a comparison of 'Discovery Year' against 'Discovery Type'. The discovery year was part of the original scope of the project. There are two large spikes of data for years 2014 and 2016 which contains most of the data available.<br/><br/>
					The graph supports the original scope of the project where planets are organised based on a time graph of discovery and associated discovery type. This will be a main supporting feature of the design. The high spikes of data potentially lead to too much data shown for one year, and more investigation is needed to quantify useability of the data.  The data can be used to identify when collation of data started to get more sophisticated, accurate and complete, as well as when significant events started to increase the reporting of discoveries. This data will have significant relevance to the planet chart below.

					<h4>Planet Chart. (Click to view larger image)</h4>
					<p>
					This planet chart is a representation of the location of planets plotted on a map. The chart highlights a very significant event in the discovery of planets. Kepler was started in 2009 to focus on a specific spot, and has since located and collated an immense quantity of the data being used. The data of 'Right-ascension' and 'Declination' were converted to degrees and charted on a scatterplot to identify visually where the planets were.<br/><br/>
					This chart is intended to be the main focus of the website due to its visual properties. A significant amount of data clustered together has the potential to lead to further information about Kepler to the audience. The spread of the stars will need a zoom feature to allow for users to select and understand individual data about the stars. Because of the intention to make this the main feature, there needs to be adequate space to let other features be available as a design consideration.

					<h4>Planet Mass and Radius Combo. (Click to view larger image)</h4>
					<p>
					'Planet Mass' and 'Planet Radius', when combined, show little variance in the mass against the size initially. Then when it reaches a threshold (red, dotted line) the variance increases dramatically, indicating potential for further discovery with temperatures and relativity to common planets.<br/><br/>
					In conjunction with the 'Discovery Year' and 'Discovery Type' data, the size and mass of the planets will be used heavily with comparisons and adjustments of data. While potentially outside the scope of the project, there is interest in seeing if the information relates to the <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung-Russell_diagram>Hertzsprung-Russel diagram</a>.

					<h4>Planets Per Star Breakup. (Click to view larger image)</h4>
					<p>
					This chart counts the number of planets that are associated with the same type of star data. It highlights that there is potential to find similar data based on planets within a system. <br/><br/>
					This chart highlights that there is capacity to cluster planets, and comparison of said planets can be used to identify unique properties of the star system. This will require more intensive work due to the lack of data on the stars themselves, and the unusual grouping of data.

				</tr>
			</table>
				<p>
					The data layout on view 1 is designed to break up the data related to individual planets and link them through to further planets as supporting information. The data on view 2 is designed to keep information compact at a slight risk of making the site too information dense and less interactive.
					<br/><br/>
					All information in the green pane at the top is data for the planet's unique properties. 
					<br/><br/>
					The bottom green pane relates to the host star data if available. The bottom green pane may resize due to the number of planets available. The bottom green pane will also have links to the other planets, allowing the user to view those planets in the upper green pane.
					<br/><br/>
					The red pane is a semi-interactive, pre-determined graph with data that changes based on user input. The graph will have a zoom function to assist with navigation, and the planets will show their primary ID when the mouse hovers over a data point. This datapoint will also be able to be selected to affect the data in the green panes. The graph will use up a significant amount of space on the web page due to the spread of data available.
					<br/><br/>
					The blue pane is interactive data manipulation. The user will be able to adjust the data in the green and red panes using the information in the blue panes. This is of the most concern due to the size constraints required for the red pane, and the user engagement utilised by the blue pane. 
				</p>
					
			<h3>	Rationale of design choices		</h3>
			
			<h4> Overarching design notes </h4>
			<p>
				Both designs work on a beginning, middle and end followed by an epilogue which leads to more supplementary information. The top of the page will focus on the data and individual planets. The bottom part of the page will focus on information that isn’t the planet itself (i.e. stars and discovery information).<br/><br/>
				The data used will focus on the most inclusive data sets, such as location, mass and radius of the planets. The remaining data of the planets or lack thereof will be displayed below.<br/><br/>
				The imagery of the site will be simplistic. Bright colours will be avoided on the planets to avoid confusion with stars. When questioning about the dataset in surveys, the most common misconception was that the data was based on stars, not planets. This changed when visual cues were added of dark brown circles, and more numerous mention of ‘planets’ were used.<br/><br/>
				The colours of the website will be low in saturation to allow better presentation of black/white or high-coloured indicators such as pictures or highlighted words. It will be limited to a darker blue, silver and black palette as indicative of expected space colours. Labels will use colours that contrast well with white, such as brown or dark orange. These will also be shaped to match aesthetics of angled and curved spaceships.<br/><br/>
			</p>
			<h4> View 1 </h4>
			<p>
				The design of view 1 is organized so that the planets are the primary focus. The view is intended to be more interactive, with spaced tools to change the data and dynamic design to receive updated data immediately. The spacing will be wider to imply that the user should take more time to ponder and think about specific information within the web page.<br/><br/>
				The website is intended to be watched first, then interacted upon. Pre-selected data will be used as initial data and the user will learn and manipulate data with intuitive tools and symbols. The words are intended to be minimal, focusing on visualization and representation.<br/><br/>
				The data presented will be used with imagery that indicates mnemonic values. The amount of data then presented will be reduced to maintain consistency of presentation. Data such as ascending node and longitude will be removed, along with age of the planet.<br/><br/>

			</p>
			
			<h4> View 2 </h4>
			<p>
				The design of view 2 is more information oriented than interaction oriented. There will be no initial information displayed except for the star chart, with search boxes to its left, and display options at the top. The users are immediately expected to try and engage with the options to find and analyse potential data.<br/><br/>
				The data will be spaced neatly and more compact. This will allow for greater space for the planet chart to be viewed, slightly reducing how much interaction is needed to see data.<br/><br/>
				Data is searched through textboxes and then submitted by the user rather than sliders for maximum and minimum values. This allows the space taken up to be minimized, and provides a clean, modern and tight feel to display. <br/><br/>
				All information is kept by this view and portrayed neatly with no graphics except for the planet, which will still have a graphical representation to maintain that the planet is not a star. There will also be supplementary information provided including the mean, mode and median of certain data points. The most used data will be the planet size, mass, discovery year and discovery method.<br/><br/>
				Only age of the planet will be removed entirely.
