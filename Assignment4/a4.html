			<h1><u> Assignment 4</u></h1>
		   	<h2>	Interactive design components	</h2>
			<h3>	1. Compared to Assignment 1, has the Story Telling aspect of your visualisation changed?		</h3>
			<p>
					The story telling aspect has not changed much. 
					It needed to increase in the story-telling aspect, but I wasnâ€™t sure how to tell a story with the data. 
					I feel that by trying to explain more of the data, I have decreased the story telling, and made it more exploratory in nature.
					<br/><br/>

					The story has changed slightly in that the planets now have sizes relative to planet size (relative to each other to fit on the chart). 
					Users can now see the difference between different planets and can explore more based on visual cues.
					The slight varience on the chart also indicates that there is differences between the planets without having to look.<br/><br/>

			</p>
			
			<h3>	2. Did the visual design of your project change of the last two months? 	</h3>
			<p>
					The visual design did change over since the last assignment. 
					The intention to add linked planets was removed. 
					While this addition was a visual and more story-oriented aspect, but the additions required have proved too difficult to add while trying to fix and tweak the other designs.<br/><br/>

					Maximum values were added to the design.<br/><br/>

					The aster graph was intended to be more graphical, but it was reduced to save space for information.<br/><br/>
					
					Apart from these small changes, the design of the website changed minimally, and reduced features rather than increased features.<br/><br/>

			</p>
			
			<h3>	3. Are there any dangers of your final product possibly misleading the audience?		</h3>
			<p>
					The planets are sized so that they are visible and can be spread out as visible dots, but they can mislead the audience on how big the planets are.
					The sizes were hard to make small due to the need to be able to click on them with relative ease, and not be so large as to crowd out other data points.<br/><br/>

					The graph numbers are limited in their description, and can cause the user to struggle to understand the scope of the variables of the planets.<br/><br/>
